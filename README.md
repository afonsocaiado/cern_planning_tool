## üìã Overview

A machine learning-powered planning tool developed in collaboration with CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) and FEUP (Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto). This tool predicts and suggests activities and contributions for complex engineering tasks, helping to streamline planning processes in large-scale scientific projects.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Project Team

- **Afonso Caiado de Sousa** - Student from FEUP (Main developer)
- **Jo√£o Carlos Pascoal Faria** - Thesis supervisor (FEUP)
- **Jo√£o Pedro Mendes Moreira** - Thesis co-supervisor (FEUP)
- **Fernando Pedrosa** - CERN Thesis supervisor

## üîç Project Description

This repository contains a machine learning solution for predicting and planning complex engineering tasks, specifically developed for CERN's maintenance and operational needs. The tool analyzes historical data to suggest similar activities, predict required contributions, and optimize planning processes.

### Key Features

- **Similar Activity Identification**: Find activities with similar characteristics
- **Activity Suggestion**: Get recommendations for new activities based on context
- **Contribution Planning**: Predict necessary contributions for activities
- **Combined Suggestions**: Get comprehensive planning recommendations

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

- **[api/](api/)**: REST API implementation with endpoints for predictions and suggestions
  - Contains Docker configuration for easy deployment
  - Includes comprehensive documentation in the wiki folder
- **[data/](data/)**: CSV datasets used for training and testing the models
- **[src/](src/)**: Source code for all machine learning models and utilities
  - Supervised learning models

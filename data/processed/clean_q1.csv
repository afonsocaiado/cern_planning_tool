The CERN Hardware Alarm Monitoring Network (CHAMN) is the cabled network that integrates, through cables and alarm dispatchers, all Safety Alarms (AL3) and Technical Faults (AL2 and AL1) into the CSAM (CERN Hardware Alarm Monitoring) or TIM (Technical Infrastructure Monitoring) Systems. In order to continue delivering reliable and trustful information to these systems, the Hardware Alarm Service in BE-ICS-AS needs to renovate the SAREP-0411 (SAREP = Safety Alarm Repartiteur). This is the main alarm dispatcher in Meyrin, which concentrates big quantities of alarms and technical faults at the old TCR Â¿ Technical Control Room, situated in building 212 / 1-402. This alarm dispatcher, which was installed in the early years of CERN, has been growing and expanding through the years without a rigorous procedure. This SAREP is subject to become an important source of failures and constitutes a dangerous mix of power supplies (+24VDC, +48VDC and +110V) of various equipment.  This document summarizes the present status of the SAREP-0411, and proposes a project-oriented approach to improve the situation by upgrading and improving the Alarm Dispatcher.","Big Concentrator: The SAREP-0411 concentrates alarms and technical faults from 11 Safety Zones (between Meyrin, Prevessin and SPS BAÂ¿s), through cables, alarm dispatchers and clientÂ¿s equipment, creating an enormous and complex spider web, all interconnected. In case of an over-voltage or a short-circuit issue impacting any part of this spider web,  it creates enormous difficulties in terms of troubleshooting time and service interruption. Several safety issues have been identified in terms of electrification. This SAREP-0411 is located in a delicate location, next to diesel tanks, heating plant, electrical substations, and the main CERN warehouse. An external accident with an important impact on the SAREP-0411 cannot be excluded.","[72.0, 72.0, 72.0]","[['LS2'], ['LS2'], ['LS2']]"

The work was done years ago, and it seemed that the installation was ready. 
However, due to schedule reasons, the cryomodules were never tested in SM18 and were shipped directly in the HIE ISOLDE linac, where they were tested on line.  This year, however, we are refurbishing one of the cryomodules in SM18, and we will have to test it in September.
Going back to the status of M9, and carefully checking that all systems, it turned out that, while the vast majority of the cabling was indeed done, there are still some cables missing (a bundle of  40 cables).

Possible location behind SXL2 (outside concrete slab),"A new ALICE Online/Offline computing farm, namely O2, will be installed at P2 before LS2. The computing part of the farm will require a new room (CR0). CR0 will require 2MW electrical power (with an option of adding 500 kW). The EL and CV modifications should be done during the EYETS at latest. The facility should be available in Q2/18, and operational (full load) by 9/18. 
A meeting was held on Oct. 22/2015 (http://indico.cern.ch/event/450840/) with representatives of GS, EL, CV and HSE. The technical requirements (power, cooling etc) and safety organisation (e.g. noise) have been presented to the CERN groups  in that occasion. The baseline solution proposed by ALICE for CR0 consists of using commercial Modular Data Centers (MDC) also known as containers.

Solution 1: Multi Mode OM4 fibers . There are two possibilities: 1.1 MTP multiplexing or 1.2 MTP standard

1.1: MTP multiplexing
Required 640 fibers Multi Mode OM4 with MTP of 8 fibers (special terminal plate with MTP multiplexing: 3 MTP base-8 (front) --> 2 MTP base-12 (back)) to be plugged in 80 100GbE, SR4 (Short Range 4 channels @25Gb/s) QSFP28 optic transceivers
Suggested to use trunk cable of 96 fibers for a total of 7 trunk cables: 96x7=672 fibers (total length around 80m).

1.2: MTP standard
Required 640 fibers Multi Mode OM4 with standard MTP of 12 fibers (standard terminal plate with 12 MTPs base-12) to be plugged in 80 100GbE, SR4 (Short Range 4 channels @25Gb/s) QSFP28 optic transceivers
Suggested to use trunk cable of 144 fibers for a total of 7 trunk cables: 144x7=1008 fibers (total length around 80m).

Solution 2:  Single Mode Standard WDM fibers:
In this standard 8 channels of 100Gb can be multiplexed in one single fiber Single Mode.

The amplifiers have been bought as integrated systems with proprietary interfaces and individual modules cannot be replaced by CERN nor is the original supplier able to supply replacement for the specific high voltage power supplies of which no spares are left. If not replaced operation will stop sometime after LS2 because of unavailability of tubes.

See details of scope of activity below.

RP operational activities involve the preparation, dismantling and conditioning phases of the CNGS dismantling.
The preparation phase includes the AWAKE Run 2b dismantling as well as the Work-and-Dose Planning and the ALARA3 committee for the CNGS dismantling. It shall take place during Q1 Â¿ Q4 2024. 
The dismantling phase covers the supervision and the follow-up of the tunnel activities, which comprise the preparation of the SAS, the dismantling, and the treatment of the elements from the CNGS area before their transfer to the surface building. It also covers the follow-up of the cleaning and painting of the area. This phase further involves the radiation and contamination measurements of all elements removed from the CNGS area and the control of the workers during the different steps of the work. The dismantling phase is foreseen to take place during Q1 2025 Â¿ Q1 2026. 
The conditioning phase comprises the works in the new surface building, where the elements from the CNGS dismantling will be treated according to their dose rate and surface contamination values. The elements will furthermore be cleaned, decontaminated, painted, and temporarily stored until their transport to the Radioactive Waste Treatment Centre and Storage (RWTCS). The phase shall take place after the dismantling phase  has finished, namely during Q2 Â¿ Q4 2026. 
The PPE equipment needed during the dismantling comprises disposable overalls, overshoes, gloves and FFP3 masks. The estimated cost is based on the CERN store prices and the number of RP workers according to the dismantling phases. 
Additional RP monitors are needed during the CNGS dismantling and conditioning phases. They should be installed before the dismantling works start, thus until Q4 2024. They comprise two Hand-Foot Monitors (HFM), which will be installed in TCV4 and the new surface building, at the exit of the SAS area. Two gamma monitors are foreseen for the surface building to monitor the ambient dose equivalent rates in this area. An alpha/beta semi-portable counter is required for on-site contamination measurements.","No or insufficient operational RP support  will put the dismantling on hold.

In the scope of this project, radioactive waste management includes the procurement of on-site containers , the processing in the Radioactive Waste Treatment Centre and Storage (RWTCS), and the disposal (including shipment) into the final repository. To dispose of all radioactive material from the CNGS target area, new evacuation pathway(s) must be opened by the CERN HSE-RP group, in close collaboration with the host states.
Packaging needs for all the radioactive waste will follow the rules described in CERNÂ¿s CADRA document, in EDMS 1364231: Â¿CritÃ¨res internes au CERN pour l'acceptation des dÃ©chets radioactifsÂ¿.

Critical areas should rapidly be measured and aligned following requests from Beam Operations. Other areas are not critical yet and a long-term planning with a suitable measurement and alignment sequence should be established. The requirements in terms of measurement frequency and alignment tolerance need to be revised and formalized for all beamlines. Important to note is that the knowledge of the position can be independent of the physical alignment and the tolerance. In any case, a measurement is needed for the knowledge of the deviation, even if it can be accepted from the physics point of view and no re-alignment is required. Once the measurements are done and calculated, the displacements and re-alignments are discussed with the physicists. This
is usually the case for beam instrumentations.

Approved projects,JEAN-FREDERIC FUCHS (BE-GM-ASG),14-APR-22,TDC2 & TCC2 and all beam lines,"The first beamlines in the North Area have been installed without the todays Database support and using different software for the definition like BEATCH or Tranfert in different versions. When the survey Database (SURVEY DB) came up, the data have been introduced with the current data and definition at that time. Making any changes to these definitions affect the whole line and is therefore very critical. In the past, the strategy in terms of changes was not sufficiently rigorous and more and more doubts and differences between the todays new Mad-X definitions and the SURVEY DB are discovered.
Different initiatives have been taken to enhance and ensure the quality and homogeneity of the data and the dataflow. All BEATCH files have been re-defined with the current  Mad-X. The North Area Beam lines are going to be integrated in Layout Database (L DB) and the E2A (Engineering to Alignment) working group is targeting to enhance the overall process. Within this context, the definition of the Beamlines in the SURVEY DB need to be updated and synchronized with MAD-X. All differences need to be analyzed and treated one by one as the overall change in positions of the lines will have a huge impact on the alignment of the whole line. Every little difference must be understood and compensated if needed. In order to stay synchronized, automatic procedures and checks for updates need to be put in place. Over the lifetime of the beamlines a number of special arrangements have been introduced. Voluntary displacements or special alignment parameters for example. It is not clear today what exactly they are compensating. Those items need to be understood

Approved projects,JEAN-FREDERIC FUCHS (BE-GM-ASG),14-APR-22,TDC2 & TCC2 and all beam lines,"The majority of main magnets are supported by polyurethane jacks. Those jacks have been failing in the SPS and have all been replaced during the LS2. A particular problem for the North Area is the fact that many jacks with obsolete aluminium inserts are still in use. Those inserts tent to fail during the manipulation of the jacks and should be exchanged. During the exchange of two corrector magnets in the LS2, many main magnets have been found misaligned in the vertical direction. This is pointing to failing jacks and was confirmed by visual inspection. The worst of them have been exchanged and stabilized with mechanical jacks in order to avoid future degradation. A number of elements is supported by non-adapted systems which cannot be moved with the full load on it. Other equipment need to be either partially or completely dismounted for the alignment. New solutions following the survey guidelines should be developed to allow the alignment with the equipment installed and preferably without the need of transport team.

Approved projects,JEAN-FREDERIC FUCHS (BE-GM-ASG),14-APR-22,H6 H8,"From an alignment and measurement point of view, the North Area was not part of regular alignment and maintenance campaigns in the past decades, partially also due to missing resources. Critical areas should rapidly be measured and aligned following requests from Beam Operations. Other areas are not critical yet and a long-term planning with a suitable measurement and alignment sequence should be established. The requirements in terms of measurement frequency and alignment tolerance need to be revised and formalized for all beamlines. Important to note is that the knowledge of the position can be independent of the physical alignment and the tolerance. In any case, a measurement is needed for the knowledge of the deviation, even if it can be accepted from the physics point of view and no re-alignment is required. Once the measurements are done and calculated, the displacements and re-alignments are discussed with the physicists. This
is usually the case for beam instrumentations.

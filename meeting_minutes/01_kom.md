The meeting started with a presentation of all the members, their background and their roles in the development of this project.

Afonso is the FEUP student who will be working on this project as his master's final thesis. Professors João Pascoal Faria and João Moreira are the supervisors of the project and Fernando, Rodrigo and Jean-Philippe are the primary members involved on CERN's side.

Professor João Pascoal Faria clarified with all members that in the first phase of the project (1st semester of 22/23) the majority of the work would be related to problem understanding and a state of the art analysis, with the elaboration of the apropriate documentation by Afonso.

Some general clarifications about the project were also made, regarding the 3 month internship period at CERN, that would take place on the 2nd semester.

## Pre-meeting doubts

- CERN 3 month internship dates + allocation → I have to book it but I do have access to it + can it be in whichever period I want

## Preparation notes from supervisors meeting:

- **Predicting feature 1:**
    - At what moment is the similarity relation suggested? In real time or when you click the create button?
    - ++ details on the cloning feature
    - predictive model that wants to predict a list = ranking
    - naive-bayes → gives you the probability of being something → ranking of those probabilities
    - NDCG → evaluates ranking comparing to an ideal ranking
    - register for cloning operations?
- **Predicting feature** **2:**
    - cloning copies the requests for the contributions?
    - result = contribution list
    - iterative approach? → explore the 1st objective → continues from there
- **Predicting feature** **3:**
    - do we have register from rejected contribution requests?
